Objective
Develop a tool that automatically generates test cases from software requirements written in natural language.

Instructions:

Data Collection
Use a set of software requirements documents or download sample requirements from repositories.

Text Parsing
Parse the requirements using NLP techniques to extract key information like actors, actions, conditions, and expected outcomes.

Rule-Based (or ML-Based) Approach
Develop a rule-based system or use machine learning to generate test cases based on the parsed information.

Test Case Structure
Ensure the generated test cases include "Test Case Title," "Test Steps," "Expected Result," and "Preconditions."

Evaluation
Evaluate the quality of the generated test cases by comparing them to manually written test cases.

Report
Provide a detailed explanation of your approach, the NLP techniques used, and the effectiveness of your tool.
